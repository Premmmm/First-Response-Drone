# First Response Drone (FRD)

## About
An emergency/response vehicle is any vehicle that is designated to respond to an emergency in a life-threatening situation. The conventional emergency/response vehicles have been our main preference for all these years, but the main draw-back is the wait time. Studies show that in India the average time for a response vehicle to reach the scene is about 15 minutes. This is mainly because of the extreme population density and the poor traffic management. With FRD this delay can be reduced down to a significant amount. Our aim is to aid and support Civil Service Departments such as Medical Department, Fire and Rescue and Police Department.

This mobile application is developed with flutter and dart this acts as the client-side application.
